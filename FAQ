Q: What happens when I add/change/remove an extension?
A:
	- voicemail.conf is regenerated to reflect the change
	- sip extension information is stored in mysql
	- sip_additional.conf is regenerated
	- extensions_additional.conf is regenerated
	- meetme_additional.conf is regenerated
	- op_server.cfg is regenerated (for Flash Operator Panel)

Q: How do the changed .conf files get loaded into Asterisk?
A: When you make a change to the extension information, a red bar will appear across the top of the AMP interface.  When you have finished making changes, and wish for them to take effect, just click this red bar.  When you do this, Asterisk will perform a 'reload' (to read in the changed files).  The FOP server, op_server.pl, will also be bounced, to ensure that the changes are also seen in the FOP.
