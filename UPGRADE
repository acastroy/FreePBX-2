Upgrading freePBX is easy.  You should perform these steps on a running system.  There should be no impact to service.


Upgrading from the freePBX-version.tar.gz download from sourceforge:

- save the freePBX-version.tar.gz to /usr/src/
- cd /usr/src/ :: change to your /usr/src directory
- rm -rf freePBX :: remove your current freePBX directory (if you have one)
- tar -zxvf freePBX-version.tar.gz :: extract the new freePBX tar
- cd freePBX-version :: change to the freePBX directory
- ./install_amp :: run the install script
