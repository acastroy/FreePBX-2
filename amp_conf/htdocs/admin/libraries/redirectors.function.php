/** Abort all output, and redirect the browser's location using standard
 * FreePBX user interface variables. By default, will take POST/GET variables
 * 'type' and 'display' and pass them along in the URL. 
 * Also accepts a variable number of parameters, each being the name of a variable
 * to pass on. 
 * 
 * For example, calling redirect_standard('extdisplay','test'); will take $_REQUEST['type'], 
 * $_REQUEST['display'], $_REQUEST['extdisplay'], and $_REQUEST['test'],
 * and if any are present, use them to build a GET string (eg, "config.php?type=setup&
 * display=somemodule&extdisplay=53&test=yes", which is then passed to redirect() to send the browser
 * there.
 *
 * redirect_standard_continue does exactly the same thing but does NOT abort processing. This
 * is used when you wish to do a redirect but there is a possibility of other hooks still needing
 * to continue processing. Note that this is used in core when in 'extensions' mode, as both the
 * users and devices modules need to hook into it together.
 *
 * @param string  (optional, variable number) The name of a variable from $_REQUEST to 
 *                pass on to a GET URL.
