CHANGES to Flash Operator Panel

.09 
 Jun 8th 2004:

  - Added Message Waiting count. When passing the mouse over the envelope
    icon the status shows the New and Old messages in that mailbox

  - The server sets the CallerID when originating a call.
  
  - Changed the debug parameter in op_server.cfg to a bitmap for greater 
    control off debug output.
    
  - Changed the way it handles extension numbers (column number 4) in 
    op_buttons.cfg. Now you can specify the context where the extension 
    resides by using the syntax:
    
      extension@context  
    
    If the extension is not reachable from the default context, you must 
    specify its context there.
    
  - Changed the way it handles IAX2 channels. To specify an IAX channel you 
    have to specify its name only, without '@context', eg: 
    
      IAX2[john]

 Jun 2nd 2004:

  - Added "Extra Info" Input box

      You can write any text you want in that box. When transferring or 
      originating a call, that text will be used as the callerid text for
      that call. This way you can pass usefull information to the person
      you are transferring the call. In order for this feature to work you
      need to modify your dialplan ("extensions.conf"). There is an example
      extensions.conf provided.

  - Configurable layout of the toolbar

      The bar at the top of the flash applet is now configurable. There are
      new parameters in op_style.cfg to adjust the layout:

        clid_label=Extra Info:
        security_label=Security Code:
        btn_help_label=Help
        btn_log_label=Debug
        show_security_code=1
        show_clid_info=2
        show_status=3
        show_btn_help=4
        show_btn_debug=5

      The numbers in the show_xxx varialbes indicates the position in the 
      toolbar. If you do not want to display an element, set it to 0. 

  - Added HELP button and text to the flash movie

      You can add a help.txt file in the same directory as the flash movie
      on your webserver. This file will be displayed inside the help window
      of the flash movie. You can use basic html tags. You *must* start the
      file with the words "text="

  May 19th 2004:

  - Added conference buttons

      The channel column (first one) in op_buttons.cfg must be named with 
      the number of the meetme conference. Eg: you have a meetme conference
      number 901, the name of the channel must be '901'. Look at the example
      config.

  - Added tranfer of an empty channel to an already connected call and 
    automatically conference the three parties together

      You have two new parameters in op_server.cfg:

        auto_conference_extension
        conference_context 

      Set them up and look at op_server.cfg for an example configuration for 
      asterisk in extensions.conf and meetme.conf

  - Added origination of calls

      You can drag an available button to another available button. This
      will originate a call from the first channel to the extension defined
      in the desintation button.

  - More readable output log for op_server.pl

.06
  May 12th 2004

  - Added voicemail notification: 

      There is a new parameter in op_buttons.cfg. The last column has the 
      voicemail context of the extension. You can leave it blank and it will 
      not check/show the voicemail status for that button (if its a queue 
      button or an extension without voicemail on). 

      You also have three new parameters in op_style.cfg:

        mail_margin_left
        mail_margin_top
        mail_scale

      to set the placement and size of the voicemail icon in the button.

  - Fixed a typo that prevented the applet from working.

.04
  Apr 16th 2004

    - Changed configuration files

        The configuration files are different: in version .03 the
        op_server.cfg had the button configuration and layout. In version
        .04 that information is stored in op_buttons.cfg. There are 2 new
        parameters in op_buttons.cfg, extension and icon.

        op_server.cfg is now used for the parameters of the op_server
        itself, like port to listent to, security code, debug level. You
        don't have to modify op_server.pl anymore. All configuration is done
        in the cfg files.

        There is a new configuration file: op_style.cfg with the style and
        size of the buttons.

     - Added Queues buttons

         You can display call queues on a button. Just put the name
         of the queue as the channel name.

     - Reconnection to Asterisk Manager port

         The op_server now tries to reconnect to Asterisk Manager
         port in case of disconnection. So if you restart Asterisk
         you don't need to restart the op_server.pl, it will reconnect
         by itself.

     - Totally redone flash movie: operator_panel3.swf
     
         The flash applet in version .04 is totally rewriten. IÏt 
         has no bitmaps. All graphics are vector based, so you can
         change the style and sizes without loosing detail. There
         is no timer or status on each button in order to save space.
         You can see the status of a channel by passing the mouse
         over the red oval.

         The new op_server.pl is compatible with the flash applet
         of previous versions (operator_panel.swf), with fixed 24 
         buttons display, timers, and scrolling info on each channel.
