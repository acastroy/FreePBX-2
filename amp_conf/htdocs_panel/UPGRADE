Notes on upgrading from an older release
========================================
 
o Upgrading from version .08 to .09:

    The debug level (op_server.cfg) is now a bitmap. Now you have more
    control of the output produced by debug. The possible values are:

       1   Show Manager Events Received
       2   Show Commands set to Manager
       4   1st level debug on op_server.pl
       8   2nd level debug on op_server.pl
       16  3rd level debug on op_server.pl

    If you want full debug, set the value to 31 in op_server.cfg
    If you want to see just the events received and sent, set it to 3 (1+2) 

    The fade matrix for the buttons is slightly different. Its the first
    step towards a visual button layout configurator.

o Upgrading from version .07 to .08:

    The offset and size of the icons have changed. You will need to adjust
    your op_style.cfg. Now all the icons are aproximatly the same size and
    have the same center offset, so the margins and scale parameters will
    match from icon to icon. New layout configurations should be simpler.

    There are several new parameters in op_style.cfg, related to the  
    configurability of the toolbar. You have to add them in your current
    configuration, if you don't do it you will not see any toolbar. The
    parameters to add are:

        clid_label=Extra Info:
        security_label=Security Code:
        btn_help_label=Help
        btn_log_label=Debug
        show_security_code=1
        show_clid_info=2
        show_status=3
        show_btn_help=4
        show_btn_debug=5

    The number in show_xxx represents the order in which it is rendered. If
    you want to hide an element of the toolbar, set it to 0.

o Upgrading from version .06 to .07:

    There are two new parameters in op_server.cfg:

        auto_conference_extension = 900    
        conference_context = conferences 

    Add them to your existing configuration file. In op_server.cfg there are
    also examples of asterisk configuration files to use the 3way auto
    conferences.

o Upgrading from previous versions:

    There are three new parameters in op_sytle.cfg and a new one in
    op_buttons.cfg. See CHANGES. Just add those parameters to your current
    config files, and replace op_server.pl with the new one. The fixed 24
    buttons flash movie does not support voicemail notifications. There is a
    new index.html that scales the applet to the size of the browser window.
    Try it and use the one you like more.
