Notes on upgrading from an older release
========================================

o Upgrading from version .19 to .20:

    You can define the server number of a button in op_buttons.cfg
	using the 'server' directive. If you leave it empty, it will 
	default to Server=1

	To monitor more than one asterisk box, just repeat the sequence of
    connection parameters in op_server.cfg

		 ; Server 1
		 manager_host=1.2.3.4
		 manager_user=john
		 manager_secret=doe

		 ; Server 2
		 manager_host=1.2.3.5
		 manager_user=mary
		 manager_secret=poppins

	To add text legends, the format is:

		[LEGEND]
		x=535
		y=50
		text=Conferences
		font_size=32
		font_family=Arial
		use_embed_fonts=1

	To add park slot buttons, the format is:

		[PARK701]
		Position=17
		Icon=3
		Extension=700
		Label="Park 701"

	You can specify the mailbox for a button with the mailbox parameter:

		[SIP/100]
		Position=1
		Mailbox=100@default
		...

	The 'old way' still works, by using the combination of Extension and
	Voicemail_Context. I recommend you to use the new format as it is more
	flexible (you can monitor a mailbox independant from the extension of
    that button).


	New directives in op_server.cfg

 	  rename_label_wildcard
	  barge_muted
      clid_privacy
      show_ip

o Upgrading from version .18 to .19:

	In op_style.cfg there is a new paramter to confgure the 
    highlighting color for the buttons:

      btn_highlight_color=ff0000

o Upgrading from version .17 to .18:

    The default .swf client is now the ming port. The new features
    are available only in the ming port. The flash .swf is included
    but it was not tested.

    In op_style.cfg there are new parameters (to configure led colors):

      ledcolor_ready
      ledcolor_busy
      ledcolor_agent

    The parameter led_color is not used anymore. (It is used by the 
    flash client only, not the default ming client)

    In op_server.cfg there are new options too (all commented in 
    op_server.cfg itsef):

      rename_label_agentlogin
      rename_label_callbacklogin
      rename_to_agent_name 
      rename_queue_member
      change_led_agent   
      clicktodial_insecure

    It is possible now to draw rectangles, see op_buttons.cfg for 
    an example.

    If you use click-to-dial, the button used to originate the call
    must be specified when invoking the .swf file. The parameter used
    is 'dial'. See index-clicktodial.html for an example.

o Upgrading from version .16 to .17:

    Just replace op_server.pl and your favorite .swf client. Its
    mostly a bug fix release. The new features do not require 
    configuration changes.

o Upgrading from version .15 to .16:

    The help window is now a browser windows that loads help.html 
	(instead of being a flash window that loads the help.txt file)
    So you need to put a help.html page in the same location as the
    .swf file.

    There are a couple of new parameters. In op_server.cfg

       poll_voicemail

         Will check for voicemail status every poll_interval seconds.
         Remeber that poll_interval will also check for sip peers.

       rename_label_agentlogin
       rename_label_callbacklogin

         Both parameters acomplish the same goal: to rename a button
         label when an Agent logs in. One of them works with the regular
         AgentLogin application. The other one with AgentCallbackLogin.
         For the later, you need to have a button with the same extension
         and context for the callback for it to work.

    There is also a new parameter in op_style.cfg

        enable_crypto (1 for enable, 0 for disable)

          If you want to encrypt server to client messages, turn this on.

o Upgrading from version .14 to .15:

    The format of the configuration file is different. You have to
    run ./convert_config_pre_14.pl in order to convert your old
    configuration files to the new format. The conversion utility
    must reside in the same directory as the old configuration files:

       op_server.cfg
       op_style.cfg
       op_buttons.cfg

    When you run the conversion routine, it will backup your old 
    configuration files and do its thing. Just in case, backup the
    files yourself. The conversion program does not have extensive
    error checking.

    The barge-in functionality has changed also. You no longer need
    an auto_conference_extension in your dialplan. The panel will 
    keep track of the conferences itself. You *do* need to add the
    conference room numbers that must be used for barge-in. The 
    conversion routine adds the parameter, you have to modify it to
    suit your needs. The new parameter (in op_server.cfg) is:

		barge_rooms

	It must have at least two rooms defined, with the format:
	"minor-major". Those rooms must be defined in your extensions.conf
    under the context defined by conference_context. The extension
    number must match the meetme room number. See op_server.cfg for
    an example.

	To authenticate using MD5 to Asterisk Manager you can add the parameter
	auth_md5=1 in op_server.cfg. It is enabled by default.

    There are new parameter in op_style.cfg: 

		enable_animation: it will animate the phone icons when ringing.

		use_embed_font: lets you choose between embed fonts or system fonts.

		(1 for enable, 0 for disable)
    

o Upgrading from version .13 to .14:
   
    In Asterisk RC1, the IAX naming convention has changed. There are
    no more brackets in IAX2 channel names. If you run RC1 (try it!)
    you will have to name your IAX2 channels like:

      IAX2/user

    You will have to rename your op_buttons.cfg if you use IAX2 channels.

    The code for handling the previous naming convention is still there
    but I have not tested it. It might or might not work.

    There are new elements in op_style that affects the button style:

       arrow_scale
       arrow_margin_top
       arrow_margin_left

       The above parameters indicate the size and position of a little
       arrow that shows the 'direction' of the call. 

       detail_title=Last call details
       detail_from=From:
       detail_to=To:
       detail_duration=Duration:

       These four parameters are for setting the text displayed in the
       detail box when you double click on the little arrow after a call
       is made.

       led_color

       The color scheme for the available/busy led.
         0 for leds green/red. (default)
         1 for leds grey/green 

       label_shadow

       You can add a shadow to the text label
         0 for disabling the shadow (default)
         1 for enabling the shadow


    There is a new parameter in op_server.cfg:

      clid_format

        This mask will apply to the callerid field to format the
        number as you see fit. Every 'x' will be replaced by a number
        from right to left. Any other char will be preserved. Ex:
	(xxx) xxx-xxxx

o Upgrading from version .12 to .13:

    For the timer to work, you need to add four new parameters to
    op_style.cfg

       timer_font_size
       timer_font_family
       timer_margin_top
       timer_margin_left

o Upgrading from version .11 to .12:

    There are 4 new parameters in op_style.cfg for the caller id
    display on each button.

        clid_font_size
        clid_font_family
        clid_margin_top
        clid_margin_left

o Upgrading from version .10 to .11:

    There are no new parameters in the configuration files. Your .10
    configuration should work fine with version .11

    The debug level bitmap is now different:

       1   Show Manager Events Received
       2   Show Commands set to Manager
       4   Show Flash events Received
       8   Show events sent to Flash Clients
       16  1st level Debug on op_server.pl
       32  2nd level Debug on op_server.pl
       64  3rd level Debug on op_server.pl

o Upgrading from version .09 to .10:

    There are 2 new parameters in op_style.cfg for a new element
    in the toolbar (a reload button)

	btn_reload_label
	show_btn_reload


o Upgrading from version .08 to .09:

    The debug level (op_server.cfg) is now a bitmap. Now you have more
    control of the output produced by debug. The possible values are:

       1   Show Manager Events Received
       2   Show Commands set to Manager
       4   1st level debug on op_server.pl
       8   2nd level debug on op_server.pl
       16  3rd level debug on op_server.pl

    If you want full debug, set the value to 31 in op_server.cfg
    If you want to see just the events received and sent, set it to 3 (1+2) 

    The fade matrix for the buttons is slightly different. Its the first
    step towards a visual button layout configurator.

o Upgrading from version .07 to .08:

    The offset and size of the icons have changed. You will need to adjust
    your op_style.cfg. Now all the icons are aproximatly the same size and
    have the same center offset, so the margins and scale parameters will
    match from icon to icon. New layout configurations should be simpler.

    There are several new parameters in op_style.cfg, related to the  
    configurability of the toolbar. You have to add them in your current
    configuration, if you don't do it you will not see any toolbar. The
    parameters to add are:

        clid_label=Extra Info:
        security_label=Security Code:
        btn_help_label=Help
        btn_log_label=Debug
        show_security_code=1
        show_clid_info=2
        show_status=3
        show_btn_help=4
        show_btn_debug=5

    The number in show_xxx represents the order in which it is rendered. If
    you want to hide an element of the toolbar, set it to 0.

o Upgrading from version .06 to .07:

    There are two new parameters in op_server.cfg:

        auto_conference_extension = 900    
        conference_context = conferences 

    Add them to your existing configuration file. In op_server.cfg there are
    also examples of asterisk configuration files to use the 3way auto
    conferences.

o Upgrading from previous versions:

    There are three new parameters in op_sytle.cfg and a new one in
    op_buttons.cfg. See CHANGES. Just add those parameters to your current
    config files, and replace op_server.pl with the new one. The fixed 24
    buttons flash movie does not support voicemail notifications. There is a
    new index.html that scales the applet to the size of the browser window.
    Try it and use the one you like more.
