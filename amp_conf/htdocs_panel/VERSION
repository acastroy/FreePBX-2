Version .04   04/16/2004

* A lot of changes, read CHANGES for a summary. There is 
  no upgrade path. Just install the new version by itself.
  If you dont like the new flash applet, you can use the
  one of version .03 with the new improved op_server.pl
  in this version.

* Added extension paramenter to op_buttons.cfg. The extension
  will be used for performing transfers. In the previous version
  you could not transfer to extensions named different than their
  respective number.

* The server can reconnect to asterisk if the connection is lost.
  You can restart asterisk an op_server.pl will reconnect by 
  itself.

* You can display call queues in a button

Version .03   04/02/2004

* Changed the way it handles channel names. Now it works 
with IAX2, MGCP and CAPI. The channel names on op_server.cfg
are case insensitive now.

* The counter on button 13 in the flash client was corrected.

--------
Version .02  04/01/2004
